# **The "Web"**:

The web is the platform of choice for this course, and understanding its underlying principles is essential. The web operates across different operating systems and hardware architectures, which makes it a powerful, universal platform for building applications.

#### **Why the Web?**

1.  **Cross-Platform**: The web is agnostic to the operating system, meaning it can work across different devices (PCs, mobile phones, etc.) with different OSs (Windows, macOS, Android, iOS).
    
2.  **Built on Sound Principles**: The web is founded on protocols and technologies that allow applications to function in a distributed manner (client-server model). Itâ€™s important to understand both the limitations (e.g., data transfer speed, bandwidth) and costs associated with running web-based services.
    
3.  **Scalability**: Web applications can be scaled to serve millions of users worldwide, often utilizing cloud infrastructure.

### **Historical Background**:

Understanding the evolution of the web provides important context for building modern web apps.

1.  **Telephone Networks (~1890+)**:  
    Early communication systems were circuit-switched, meaning physical wires remained occupied for the duration of a call, which was inefficient.
    
2.  **Packet-Switched Networks (~1960s)**:  
    In contrast, packet-switched networks allowed data to be transmitted in small packets, only occupying the network when data was being sent. This system is far more efficient than the circuit-switched system.
    
    -   **ARPANet (1969)**: One of the first packet-switched networks, which evolved into the modern internet.
        
3.  **Protocol Evolution**:
    
    -   **IP (Internet Protocol)**: Introduced in 1983, this protocol allowed different network protocols to communicate with each other, facilitating the rise of the internet as we know it today.
        
    -   **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**: Also introduced in 1983, TCP ensures reliable data transmission by managing retries, error control, and adjusting to network limitations.

### **Where Are We Now?**:

Web development has evolved significantly from its static origins.

1.  **Early Web (Static Pages)**:
    
    -   The original web featured static pages with limited interactivity. The content was fixed, and browsing was simple.
        
    -   Challenges included limited styling and compatibility issues across browsers.
        
2.  **Web 2.0 (~2004+)**:
    
    -   **Dynamic Pages**: Content can be generated on the fly, based on user input or data from a database.
        
    -   **HTTP as a Transport Mechanism**: HTTP started supporting more than just text; binary data, serialized objects, and dynamic content became common.
        
    -   **Client-Side Computation**: JavaScript (and later frameworks like React and Angular) began enabling more interactive, real-time applications.
        
    -   **Cross-Platform Operating Systems**: Web apps became OS-independent, accessible from any device with a browser.
